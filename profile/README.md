# Welcome! 

This is the GitHub Organization for the UC Berkeley School of Information course, "INFO 241." In this organization you will find the course's repository, stored at `info-241`, and solution sets to problems. 

# Course Repository 

The course respository is at [INFO 241](https://github.com/info-241/info-241). 

# Solution Sets 

The solutions for the problem sets are included below. (Don't worry... you won't have access to these solution sets until we release them. Before then, they'll just 404 for you). 

- Solution Set 1: [[link](https://github.com/info-241/problem-set-1-solution)]
- Solution Set 2: [[link](https://github.com/info-241/problem-set-2-solution)]

# Instructional Team Links 

Don't worry about access to these hidden materials ahead of time. These links aren't going to be available for students because we're going to have you provision your work from somewhere else.
